# Using Data Driven Tests and Jobs in TestProject (Adding Parameter or Multiple Parameters)

## What are the input parameters in TestProject?

TestProject allows usage of *two different types* of input parameters: first, being a **preset** value and the second being a value from a **data source**.

- *`Preset` value means the value that is set up directly into the element, and will stay constant unless edited in the TestProject dashboard.*
- *`Data source` values mean values picked up from an external data source like an excel file, where the value will change depending on what data is within the file*.

## Input parameters can have various access levels, which can be classified as follows:

- *`Test Level / Type Parameters:` The first one is the test type parameter; we can access these parameters only in the test case in which we define them.*
- *`Project Level / Type Parameters:` The second one is the project type parameter; these parameters are accessible from any test across the entire project. Project type parameters are quite useful in defining constant project parameters used in many different test cases, as an application URL.*

## Parameterize Inputs

### Input Parameters
- Once you have a test setup, the first thing you will need to do is to parameterize the variable that you want to use to drive the test. 
- To do that open the test in the test editor by clicking on it in the project view. You can then open the parameters panel for that test from the more menu.

- You can then add a new parameter with the plus button at the bottom of the panel.

    ![Alt text](../AutomationTesting(TestProject)/_images/NewParameter.png)

- Fill in the name, description and value for the parameter and click on the add button to add it to your test.

    ![Alt text](../AutomationTesting(TestProject)/_images/SaveParameter.png)

    This parameter is now ready to be used in the test. 

- Navigate to the test step where you want to use it and click on that step in the step editor. Find the Input parameters section on the editing panel and click on the plus beside the input parameter you are interested in.

- Clear any text already entered and then choose the parameter you created from the list of parameters.

    ![Alt text](../AutomationTesting(TestProject)/_images/ChooseParameters.png)

    This will add the parameter as a variable in the input field and you can click on the check mark at the bottom of the panel to apply the change.

- Click on the Save button on the test step panel and you will now have your input field parameterized.

### Output parameters

- Output parameters hold information that is generated by any of the test steps in the TestProject. 
- In some ways, you can think of it as the opposite of the input parameter. In the input parameter, values are provided by the parameter to the test.  Whereas with the output parameter, values are provided by the test to the parameter.  Since the test itself assigns the value of the output parameter, so it's necessary not to assign any value to the output parameter while defining it.

- They can be used to pass data between tests or validate fields contain the correct values. For example, let's say we have a scenario where we pick data from one field and enter that data into another field.

### `To understand the output parameter, we will take an example of the test step with the "get the text" action.`

1. Navigate to the test and click on the test step with get text action. A panel will open, scrolling down a little will show **Output Parameter** section as displayed in the image below.

*`Note*: The output parameter section is only available for specific actions performed on an element, such as 'Get Text'.`*

2. In this section, click on the **"Select Parameter"** link as marked in the image above. The output parameter panel will open up, as shown below:

After saving the parameter we can see it in the listing page

3. Finally Edit the step where we want to link this Output parameter

## Generating a Data Source
 
> When testing the same application set the Parameter ApplicationURL to Private like in the image below before generating a Template. Setting a Parameter to private will hide it when providing a Data Source. do the same for every parameter you are not planning to override with the data source.

In order to run a data driven test, you will need to create the data that you want to use and add it to the system. 

- Go to the test you want to generate data for and use the more menu on it to download a CSV Parameters Template. 

    ![Alt text](../AutomationTesting(TestProject)/_images/CSVTemp.png)

    This will download a .csv file to your computer with headers for each of the parameters you have defined in your test. 

- You can open the file in Excel or any other spreadsheet editing program and add in rows for each input you want to add.

    ![Alt text](../AutomationTesting(TestProject)/_images/ExcelParam.png)

- Once you have added the data that you want you can save the file as a .csv file again and upload it back into the TestProject app. To do that, go to the Data Sources menu option and choose to Add a data file.

    ![Alt text](../AutomationTesting(TestProject)/_images/SaveDataSource.png)

    Choose the .csv file you created and give it a name on click on Create. This will add the file to the system as an input source that you can use.

### Running Tests with a Data Source

Now that there is a data source in your project you can use it to drive your test. 

- Click on Run icon for the test and choose the agent and platform that you will run the test on.

    ![Alt text](../AutomationTesting(TestProject)/_images/RunTest.png)

- On the next page , choose Browser and Agent.
- On the next page, you will be prompted for fill in the parameters for that test. To run a data driven test, enable the Override default input parameters option.

    ![Alt text](../AutomationTesting(TestProject)/_images/UseDataSource.png)

    You can then select the data source you previously added and click on run.  The test will run once for each row that you have added in the .csv file using the input for that row.
