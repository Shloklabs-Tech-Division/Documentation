# ABP Documentation

ABP Framework offers an **opinionated architecture** to build enterprise software solutions with **best practices** on top of the **.NET** and the **ASP.NET Core** platforms. It provides the fundamental infrastructure, production-ready startup templates, modules, themes, tooling, guides and documentation to implement that architecture properly and **automate the details** and repetitive works as much as possible.
